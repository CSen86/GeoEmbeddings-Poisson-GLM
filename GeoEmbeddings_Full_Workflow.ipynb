        "# Geographic Embeddings for Poisson GLM — A Complete Workflow\n",

        "## What This Notebook Is About\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you are an actuary trying to predict how many insurance claims will occur across different geographic locations. Intuitively, where a policy is located matters enormously: a house in a flood-prone coastal area should be priced differently from one in a quiet inland suburb. The challenge is that **geography is hard to encode well in a traditional statistical model**.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook walks you through a modern, practical solution to that challenge: **geographic embeddings** learned by a neural autoencoder, which are then plugged into a classic Poisson GLM for claim frequency modelling.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end, you will understand:\n",
        "- Why raw geographic coordinates or hand-crafted spatial variables often fail to capture spatial risk\n",
        "- What an autoencoder is and why it is useful for representation learning\n",
        "- How to train an autoencoder on spatial features and extract compact embeddings\n",
        "- How to incorporate those embeddings into a Poisson GLM\n",
        "- How to evaluate whether the embeddings actually improve predictive performance\n",

        "## The Core Problem: Geography Is Messy\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional GLMs work well with structured, low-dimensional inputs like age, vehicle type, or building age. But geography creates three specific difficulties:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Raw coordinates are not meaningful features.**  \n",
        "If you simply include latitude and longitude in a GLM, you are assuming that claim risk changes linearly as you move north or east. That is almost never true. Risk can be high in one small region and low two kilometres away, for reasons that a linear model cannot capture.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Spatial features interact in complex, nonlinear ways.**  \n",
        "Flood risk, population density, elevation, and income are all spatially correlated, but their *joint* effect on claims is nonlinear. Manually engineering interaction terms is tedious and prone to omitting important combinations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. High dimensionality is impractical in a GLM.**  \n",
        "You might have dozens of spatial covariates (census variables, hazard indices, terrain metrics). Adding all of them directly to a GLM results in overfitting, multicollinearity, and uninterpretable coefficients.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Solution: Learn a Spatial Representation\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of feeding raw spatial features directly into the GLM, we first **compress them** into a small, dense vector — called an **embedding** — using an autoencoder neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "An **autoencoder** is a neural network trained to reconstruct its own input. It does this by passing the data through a narrow bottleneck (the latent layer), which forces the network to learn a compact representation that captures the most important structure in the data. In our case:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Input:** 8 spatial features per location (coordinates, hazard indices, demographics, terrain)\n",
        "- **Bottleneck:** 5-dimensional embedding vector\n",
        "- **Output:** Reconstruction of the original 8 features\n",
        "\n",
        "The bottleneck forces the network to summarise what is most geographically distinctive about each location in just 5 numbers. Once the autoencoder is trained, we discard the decoder and use only the encoder to transform each policy's location into a 5-dimensional embedding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Those 5 embedding dimensions are then added as features to a Poisson GLM. The GLM remains fully interpretable and auditable, but it now benefits from a richer, more nuanced representation of spatial risk.\n",

        "\n",
        "We implemented a two-stage modelling pipeline for insurance claim frequency:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **A spatial autoencoder** trained on 8 geographic features, which compresses each location into a 5-dimensional embedding. The autoencoder is trained unsupervised — it learns from the spatial features alone, without using claim counts at all.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Two Poisson GLMs** — one using only traditional policy features, and one augmented with the learned spatial embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What we demonstrated\n",
        "\n",
        "The enhanced GLM outperformed the baseline because:\n",
        "- The simulation was designed with spatial features as major claim drivers\n",
        "- The autoencoder successfully compressed nonlinear spatial structure into a form the linear GLM could use\n",
        "- The 5 embedding dimensions act as a learned spatial smoother — a data-driven alternative to hand-crafted spatial interaction terms\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why this approach is practically useful\n",
        "\n",
        "| Challenge | How geo-embeddings help |\n",
        "|---|---|\n",
        "| Raw coordinates are not meaningful features | Coordinates become inputs to a learned function, not direct predictors |\n",
        "| Spatial features interact nonlinearly | The autoencoder captures interactions; the GLM sees only the compressed result |\n",
        "| High-dimensional spatial data | Compressed to a small, fixed-size vector regardless of input dimensionality |\n",
        "| Model interpretability | GLM structure is preserved; embeddings are additional numeric inputs |\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations and extensions\n",
        "\n",
        "- **No feature standardisation:** In practice, standardise inputs before training the autoencoder. This avoids features with larger absolute values dominating the loss.\n",
        "- **No hyperparameter tuning:** The latent dimension (5) and architecture were chosen heuristically. In production, these should be cross-validated.\n",
        "- **Unsupervised pretraining:** The autoencoder is trained without seeing claim counts. A supervised variant (e.g., an encoder trained jointly with the GLM) could in principle capture more task-relevant spatial structure.\n",
        "- **Grid-level embeddings:** In a real application, you might train the autoencoder on geographic grid cells rather than individual policies, then join embeddings to policies by location. This is the approach described in Blier-Wong et al. (2021).\n",
